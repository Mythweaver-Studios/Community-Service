The world is divided between the waking realm and the Dream Realm, a place where monsters born of fear and madness roam freely. Only a few, chosen by fate or misfortune, can enter this twisted dimension: Awakened.

Sunless, or Sunny as he’s mockingly named, is a slave. Born without status, purpose, or hope, he lives a life of hardship in the bottom rungs of a caste-ridden society ruled by Awakened elites. With no family, no power, and no future, his fate seems sealed—until the day he is forcibly inducted into the Dream Realm by an ancient spell.

Thrown into a grotesque world of shifting shadows, deadly creatures, and cryptic ruins, Sunny discovers that the Dream Realm is not merely a battlefield—but a crucible that will either break or reshape him. He is cursed with a strange and nearly useless Aspect, no mentor, no resources, and no understanding of the terrifying reality he's trapped in. Unlike others, he has no heroic path laid before him—only desperation and the bitter will to survive.

But Sunny has something else: cunning. Ruthless, paranoid, and more observant than most, he begins to unravel the logic of the Dream Realm. With every deadly encounter, he grows not through strength alone, but by learning its hidden rules, exploiting its systems, and mastering its ancient magic. He befriends—or manipulates—those stronger than him. He steals power from those who underestimate him. In a world ruled by raw force, he sharpens his mind into a weapon.

Yet even as he claws his way up from nothing, deeper mysteries take shape. What is the true nature of the Spell that governs this realm? What secrets lie in the ancient city beneath the dreamscape? And what is the cost of ascending to greatness in a place built on death and forgotten gods?

Shadow Slave is not a tale of heroes, but of survivors. It is a story about fear, obsession, sacrifice, and the thin line between darkness and control. Sunny's path is drenched in blood and shadow—not because he seeks power, but because he refuses to die weak and forgotten.

In the Dream Realm, your nightmares define you. And Sunny… Sunny is learning to control his.`;
