# React Scripts Reference

This document provides a reference for the standard scripts included with Create React App, which this project is based on. The original `README.md` from CRA has been moved here to avoid confusion with the main project `README.md`.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`
Runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will automatically reload when you make changes.

### `npm test`
Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. This is used for running unit and component tests with Jest and React Testing Library.

### `npm run build`
Builds the app for production into the `build` folder. It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance. The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes for cache busting. Your app is ready to be deployed after this step.

### `npm run eject`
**Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you cannot go back!**

This command removes the single build dependency from your project and copies all the configuration files (Webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project. This gives you full control over the configuration but also makes you responsible for maintaining it. You should only use this if you have a specific configuration need that cannot be met otherwise. For this project, **it is highly recommended not to eject.**
